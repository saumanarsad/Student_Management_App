# Student_Management_App

I have created a simple CRUD application in django. There are 3 main interfaces

1. Homepage (index.html):
This page displays all the students along with the option to delete or update them

2. Add a student:
If someone wants to add a new student in the database, he can do that by pressing the add student button. This navigates them to a new page where he can enter he student details to be stored in the database

3. Update student:
If you wish to update the enteries of a specific student, you can by pressing the update button. Then he navigates to a page where he can enter the updated values of the student

4. Delete student:
After pressing the delete button , the whole record of the student will be deleted from the database.

Concepts and technologies used:
Python, Django admin panel, django model view template architecture, and basic html and some CSS
